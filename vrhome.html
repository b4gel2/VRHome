	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Plan and progress</h1>
	<p>VR Home will be a virtual reality (VR) tool that provides a first-person view of the interior and exterior of a house before it is built, giving an opportunity for architects and potential buyers to get an idea of what the house will look like after construction.</p>
	<p>We had a long list of different project proposals given by our participants, but after a lengthy discussion over what project we would settle on, the seven of us decided on this virtual reality tool, which we later named VR Home. After making our decision, we got to work immediately. We started by developing a plan on how we were going to go about the project. We felt that 14 weeks would be enough to get everything done. The first four weeks of the project would be used to compare different designs and make prototypes to get a better understanding of how to develop VR Home. In the fifth week of the project, we would present our new upcoming creation to the world, before commencing the development phase of the project. We are now on the verge of making our first presentation of VR Home.</p>
	<p>The design phase began with deciding on what the project was to achieve and how those “achievements” were to be achieved. This included identifying a scope (what should be done and not be done) and limits to the project (time, costs, etc). As this was part of an assignment, we had a deadline to meet, which we successfully did meet. After completing this first task, we began with the design stage of VR Home. We needed to decide on computer programs that we could use to test designs. After discussing it as a group and testing out a range of software, we decided on four different programs: Unity, Adobe XD, Metal and AR Kit.</p>
	<p>Once we were happy with the designs and once we made the first public presentation of VR Home, we could commence the development stage. The development stage is a complicated one, as there many things we need to get in order before the finished product can be completed. To begin with, we are in need of a virtual reality headset, which can be from either HTC or Oculus, which are the devices we intend to make VR Home accessible on. We will obtain multiple headsets in case we run into any errors on any devices. Having obtained a bunch of headsets, we will then start negotiating with real-estate agents that may want to use our products. Our sales and marketing manager Mason will be responsible for this, and will be accompanied by our accountant Nicholas when negotiating; it will include giving the agents a test run of the software, before agreeing to a price that the agent will pay us for use of our product. After this, we will go around performing surveys in public, asking people what they would look to get out of this innovation. This will then allow us to make a list of customer needs and wants that we can work towards while continuing the development of VR Home.</p>
	<p>Once we have come to an agreement with our choice of real-estate agents, we will begin building the software for VR Home. Brian will be the lead software developer, and will be assisted by fellow software developers Atilla and Sam. In addition to his software development duties, Atilla will also be the lead user-interface designer. When the software is ready to go, Naufal will start the process of implementing the software into the virtual reality devices we have acquired. As the development stage progresses, we will continuously inspect the safety of the product, which will be done by our quality control manager Harrison.</p>
	<p>By the end of week 12, development of the final product is expected to be finished, before being tested and sold off to the real estate agents we negotiated with. Product testing will occur in week 13, and will be performed by Sam, along with his duty as a software developer. It will be a final test to see whether the product works as intended, and to see if there are any defects present. If any defects do exist, the product will go back to our software developers and quality control manager, who will work together to try and fix any issues. If no defects are present, and tests show that the product works the way it should, VR Home will be officially be ready for use the following week.</p>

	<h1>Scope and limitations</h1>

	<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
	<h2>Unity 3D</h2>
	<p>To develop the VR home inspection software we have chosen Unity as it is easy to use and free. The version of Unity being used will be the latest version of Unity that being Unity 2019.2. In addition, the VR home inspection software will need a VR headset which comes with its own dedicated VR controllers, for this reason The Oculus Quest will be most suited as it does not need external wires and does not rely on a PC. Through the use of the Oculus touch controllers users will be able to move freely within the confines of the chosen house to inspect all that is within, ranging from furniture to the unique colours of the walls inside rooms. A few group members have used Unity before to develop games, however, members lack experience when developing VR applications, this will impact the development process and cause problems with time constraints.

	<h2>Adobe XD</h2>
	<p>We are using Adobe XD for wireframing and mocking up our prototypes. It allows us to keep a consistent skeleton and navigation UI whilst all collaborating on different designs/views. XD also allows us to maintain a  consistent design pattern & UI elements throughout the app, which ultimately results in a more consistent look and feel. A few group members also have had previous experience with Adobe XD, which means we can rapidly scaffold the prototypes with ease.

	<h2>Metal (apart of the iOS SDK)</h2>
	<p>One of our primary platforms we will be developing to is iOS. Apple provides a simple API/ SDK that we can leverage to optimise our graphics and VR workloads with this near-direct access to the onboard GPU’s of the devices</p>

	<h2>AR Kit</h2>

	<h1>Testing</h2>
	<p>We will test our project with users in small sample groups of 5 participants which will all use the program in an ideal environment, in which they will be instructed to perform a range of tasks, and will be given a score on criteria such as effectiveness and efficiency. Areas which scores reflected poorly will be reevaluated and manipulated do better suit the users wants and needs.</p>
	<p>When we have succeeded in the program will meet the requirements that we intended in design and development stages. Furthermore, including the program responds correctly to all kinds of inputs such as the use and functionality of buttons, the program performs its functions in a reasonable timeframe, it is stable and doesn’t crash and most importantly achieves the key results the stakeholders desire.</p>
	<p>Surveys will be used as a means of sourcing test users and gather information about the users wants and needs but also their expectations of the working solution. A small group of approximately 10 individuals will be selected, the criteria in which will be used to select them will be the following: Individual wanting to buy/rent a home, Relatively tech savvy, between the ages of 25-30. Etc.</p>
	<h1>Timeframe</h1>
	<p>For our timeline we have broken it down into two sections.  The first 4 weeks which lead up to the presentation and then the next 10 weeks which is how we would plan our schedules if we were to go on and create this idea.  Furthermore we have developed a week by week framework which outlines the rough structure for how many hours we loosely plan on dedicating to rough tasks to complete our idea.  As VR Home is not required to be built by our presentation in week 5 we have dedicated our first 4 weeks into scoping and developing the technology and design required to improve the understanding shown in our presentation.  The next 10 weeks are dedicated to the build and design of the application as well as the organising of all business related side of the process such as marketing and meeting with companies to persuade and convince them to allow us to import there catalogues to assist with interior design.  Not only this but meeting with real estate companies to come to agreements and working out the finer details on how this application will benefit them and working around the rules and regulations of the real estate industry</p>
	<h2>Roadmap & development plan</h2>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Scope and Limitations</h1>
	<h2>Scope and Limits for presentation in week 5</h2>
	<p>As a group we are aware that we will never be finished developing our project and so we must priorities certain milestones to be completed by certain due dates one of which is our presentation. For our presentation we are not aiming to begin development on the software of our app Vr Home, instead we will aim to develop the design and logistics of the app through descriptions, prototypes, videos and diagrams. At our presentation we aim to have an interactive prototype demonstrating the core functionality and uses of the finished product. We also aim to have considered the specific technical details such as the hardware and software required to run the app, currently we plan to have the app compatible with all high end virtual reality headsets including modern HTC and Oculus headsets. This application is not currently intended for use on mobile phone based headsets like the Google Day Dream or Samsung Gear VR because the hardware would not be adequate.</p>
	<h1>Scope and Limits for final project</h1>
	<p>The app should include all planned features including. Movement around a virtual space where handheld controllers will be used to point and click to a point in the virtual space. Controllers will also be used to navigate any necessary menus and other interactions with the virtual world. The app should include features that allow for interaction with objects within the 3D space for example furniture, object should be able to be lifted, placed, moved and rotated with the goal of allowing as much freedom as possible. Our final project should have a unique licence deal with leading furniture retailers that allows our app to access store catalogues and generate virtual 3D models of real world furniture to exact scale, colour options, and material. The final project importantly should be able to choose from a large number of current properties on sale or still under construction and quickly load a virtual interior with exact dimensions of the chosen property. Once a skeleton of the property has been virtually constructed the user should have the ability to load a view of what the property currently looks like or what it is planned to look like, from there the user can customise the interior to their liking so that they can have an idea of what their ideal interior would look like. An important use for the app will be giving customers the ability plan exactly how they would design the interior of a property before they have purchased the property. To do this many measuring tools and viewing options will be available to the user as well as the ability to customise almost every aspect of the property interior. Finally once the use is happy with the property they have chosen and the planned layout of the interior they will be able to save their design and have it printed in a detail with multiple viewing angles including a new detailed floorplan and lists of exact colours, materials, and furniture used. This will help the user to feel confident with their decision and help them bring their virtual plan into the real world.</p>
	<h1>Risks</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
	<p>For our projects, we have been using Facebook and Steam for communication. Mostly discussions take place in class or in Facebook. It is important to keep updated with the Assignment progress, and some questions could also be asked on Facebook while all the group members online. We store our assignment data in Google Drive, and some in the Canvas group. We also have access to the GitHub repository, so we can modify things in the website easily. Each group member assigned a task on this assignment when discussion in class, so when we finished the class, we already know what to do and could arrange the time to do the assignment.</p>
	<p>From our last assignment, we are now trying to get better with the group communication and more focused on each member assigned. For every unclear issues, we can communicate it in group chat or by discussing in class. Most of us did a great job for the assignment, but just need to be more careful and read all the specifications correctly to improve our skills. </p>
