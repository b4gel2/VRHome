	<h1>Plan and progress</h1>
	<p>VR Home will be a virtual reality (VR) tool that provides a first-person view of the interior and exterior of a house before it is built, giving an opportunity for architects and potential buyers to get an idea of what the house will look like after construction.</p>
	<p>We had a long list of different project proposals given by our participants, but after a lengthy discussion over what project we would settle on, the seven of us decided on this virtual reality tool, which we later named VR Home. After making our decision, we got to work immediately. We started by developing a plan on how we were going to go about the project. We felt that 14 weeks would be enough to get everything done. The first four weeks of the project would be used to compare different designs and make prototypes to get a better understanding of how to develop VR Home. In the fifth week of the project, we would present our new upcoming creation to the world, before commencing the development phase of the project. We are now on the verge of making our first presentation of VR Home.</p>
	<p>The design phase began with deciding on what the project was to achieve and how those “achievements” were to be achieved. This included identifying a scope (what should be done and not be done) and limits to the project (time, costs, etc). As this was part of an assignment, we had a deadline to meet, which we successfully did meet. After completing this first task, we began with the design stage of VR Home. We needed to decide on computer programs that we could use to test designs. After discussing it as a group and testing out a range of software, we decided on four different programs: Unity, Adobe XD, Metal and AR Kit.</p>
	<p>Once we were happy with the designs and once we made the first public presentation of VR Home, we could commence the development stage. The development stage is a complicated one, as there many things we need to get in order before the finished product can be completed. To begin with, we are in need of a virtual reality headset, which can be from either HTC or Oculus, which are the devices we intend to make VR Home accessible on. We will obtain multiple headsets in case we run into any errors on any devices. Having obtained a bunch of headsets, we will then start negotiating with real-estate agents that may want to use our products. Our sales and marketing manager Mason will be responsible for this, and will be accompanied by our accountant Nicholas when negotiating; it will include giving the agents a test run of the software, before agreeing to a price that the agent will pay us for use of our product. After this, we will go around performing surveys in public, asking people what they would look to get out of this innovation. This will then allow us to make a list of customer needs and wants that we can work towards while continuing the development of VR Home.</p>
	<p>Once we have come to an agreement with our choice of real-estate agents, we will begin building the software for VR Home. Brian will be the lead software developer, and will be assisted by fellow software developers Atilla and Sam. In addition to his software development duties, Atilla will also be the lead user-interface designer. When the software is ready to go, Naufal will start the process of implementing the software into the virtual reality devices we have acquired. As the development stage progresses, we will continuously inspect the safety of the product, which will be done by our quality control manager Harrison.</p>
	<p>By the end of week 12, development of the final product is expected to be finished, before being tested and sold off to the real estate agents we negotiated with. Product testing will occur in week 13, and will be performed by Sam, along with his duty as a software developer. It will be a final test to see whether the product works as intended, and to see if there are any defects present. If any defects do exist, the product will go back to our software developers and quality control manager, who will work together to try and fix any issues. If no defects are present, and tests show that the product works the way it should, VR Home will be officially be ready for use the following week.</p>
