	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p></p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p></p>
	<br><h1>Plan and progress</h1>
	<p>VR Home will be a virtual reality (VR) tool that provides a first-person view of the interior and exterior of a house before it is built, giving an opportunity for architects and potential buyers to get an idea of what the house will look like after construction.</p>
	<p>We had a long list of different project proposals given by our participants, but after a lengthy discussion over what project we would settle on, the seven of us decided on this virtual reality tool, which we later named VR Home. After making our decision, we got to work immediately. We started by developing a plan on how we were going to go about the project. We felt that 14 weeks would be enough to get everything done. The first four weeks of the project would be used to compare different designs and make prototypes to get a better understanding of how to develop VR Home. In the fifth week of the project, we would present our new upcoming creation to the world, before commencing the development phase of the project. We are now on the verge of making our first presentation of VR Home.</p>
	<p>The design phase began with deciding on what the project was to achieve and how those “achievements” were to be achieved. This included identifying a scope (what should be done and not be done) and limits to the project (time, costs, etc). As this was part of an assignment, we had a deadline to meet, which we successfully did meet. After completing this first task, we began with the design stage of VR Home. We needed to decide on computer programs that we could use to test designs. After discussing it as a group and testing out a range of software, we decided on four different programs: Unity, Adobe XD, Metal and AR Kit.</p>
	<p>Once we were happy with the designs and once we made the first public presentation of VR Home, we could commence the development stage. The development stage is a complicated one, as there many things we need to get in order before the finished product can be completed. To begin with, we are in need of a virtual reality headset, which can be from either HTC or Oculus, which are the devices we intend to make VR Home accessible on. We will obtain multiple headsets in case we run into any errors on any devices. Having obtained a bunch of headsets, we will then start negotiating with real-estate agents that may want to use our products. Our sales and marketing manager Mason will be responsible for this, and will be accompanied by our accountant Nicholas when negotiating; it will include giving the agents a test run of the software, before agreeing to a price that the agent will pay us for use of our product. After this, we will go around performing surveys in public, asking people what they would look to get out of this innovation. This will then allow us to make a list of customer needs and wants that we can work towards while continuing the development of VR Home.</p>
	<p>Once we have come to an agreement with our choice of real-estate agents, we will begin building the software for VR Home. Brian will be the lead software developer, and will be assisted by fellow software developers Atilla and Sam. In addition to his software development duties, Atilla will also be the lead user-interface designer. When the software is ready to go, Naufal will start the process of implementing the software into the virtual reality devices we have acquired. As the development stage progresses, we will continuously inspect the safety of the product, which will be done by our quality control manager Harrison.</p>
	<p>By the end of week 12, development of the final product is expected to be finished, before being tested and sold off to the real estate agents we negotiated with. Product testing will occur in week 13, and will be performed by Sam, along with his duty as a software developer. It will be a final test to see whether the product works as intended, and to see if there are any defects present. If any defects do exist, the product will go back to our software developers and quality control manager, who will work together to try and fix any issues. If no defects are present, and tests show that the product works the way it should, VR Home will be officially be ready for use the following week.</p>

	<br><h1>Scope and limitations</h1>
    
    <p>Our project on paper has a very large requirements specification, combining in-depth GIS mapping technology with the more experimental virtual reality. Therefore, in practice, it is not expected to see much high-fidelity prototypes for months, possibly even years from the start of the project. However, there are still many stages that can be completed within both a short-term timeframe (4 weeks) and a long-term one (16 weeks). The VR Home Team aims to help visualize the potential benefits of our idea in both the real estate industry and VR research, and a brief listing of expectations are presented in this section.</p>
    <p>Throughout our journey to making VR Home a reality, it is likely that we will experience some instances of scope creep. With high ambitions as high as they are, features and expectations that reach beyond our capabilities are bound to sneak into our specifications. To minimize these unintended features, constraints and limitations have been established. Some are inherited by the hardware and software that will be used and researched with, while some have been declared by our team after careful consideration.</p>
    
	<h2>Short Term Expectations</h2>
    
	<p>As a group we are aware that we will never be finished developing our project and so we must priorities certain milestones to be completed by certain due dates one of which is our presentation. For our presentation we are not aiming to begin development on the software of our app Vr Home, instead we will aim to develop the design and logistics of the app through descriptions, prototypes, videos and diagrams. At our presentation we aim to have an interactive prototype demonstrating the core functionality and uses of the finished product. We also aim to have considered the specific technical details such as the hardware and software required to run the app, currently we plan to have the app compatible with all high end virtual reality headsets including modern HTC and Oculus headsets. This application is not currently intended for use on mobile phone based headsets like the Google Day Dream or Samsung Gear VR because the hardware would not be adequate.</p>
    
    <p>This period will mainly be focused on the analysis and design stage of the problem-solving methodology. Our hope is to have a firm understanding of our goals and intentions with the project and have a well-established design philosophy by the end of this time frame.</p>
    <p>There are primary features for VR Home that need to be outlined as they form the basis of what is expected from the final product; if it does not possess these features, our project is not complete. These main features are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Display a 3D model of a given house</li>
        <ul><li>This house must be of high detail, allowing users to view the interior, exterior, and anything in between</li></ul>
        <li>Provide users with tools to modify and alter the displayed house</li>
        <ul><li>These options allow certain features of the house to be changed, such as colours and materials for different parts of the house</li></ul>
        <li>Allow the user to add or remove furniture in or within the vicinity of the house</li>
        <ul><li>The furniture would be from a list of licensed furniture should we gain permission and/or secure a partnership with local/large-scale furniture companies</li></ul>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Additional features may be amended but must share a connection to or expand upon one of these primary features.</p>
    
    <p>Our team will have decided on the tools and skills that will be required to successfully complete this project, we will have sourced these tools, both software and hardware, and will have commenced research in order to best prepare for the following processes of the project.</p>
    
    <p>Interface designs are to be established, with early stages of the user interface having been mocked up after a few iterations of user experience testing. Our initial report of this project has been created to accurately document the progress and processes that have commenced and completed. Additionally, a webpage will be created to publicly document our project as well as generate some premature exposure to the project before it receives any green lights.</p>
    
    <p>After more user testing, having formed some base key path scenarios, low-fidelity wireframes and paper prototypes will be crafted to get a basic idea of how both physical and digital designs affect user behaviour. With this data, development can continue while key concept art pieces are suggested.</p>
    
    <p>By the end of the 4-week period, our prototypes will have reached our minimal expectations and will be ready for presentation. Our project report will be complete, and a website will be published to document the team and their efforts.</p>
    
	<h2>Long Term Scope</h2>
    
    <p>Once the initial analysis and design period has concluded, the true development stage can commence. VR Home is expected to be in a more polished stage by the end of this period. Its design will have been finalized, for the most part, and a closed beta of the software can begin, experimenting with different locations and environments as well as gathering user data from the target groups, including ones that fit suggested personas. The website and related documentations will also have been amended and republished to maintain communication with interested individuals and most accurately present our progress.</p>
	<p>The app should include all planned features including. Movement around a virtual space where handheld controllers will be used to point and click to a point in the virtual space. Controllers will also be used to navigate any necessary menus and other interactions with the virtual world. The app should include features that allow for interaction with objects within the 3D space for example furniture, object should be able to be lifted, placed, moved and rotated with the goal of allowing as much freedom as possible. Our final project should have a unique licence deal with leading furniture retailers that allows our app to access store catalogues and generate virtual 3D models of real world furniture to exact scale, colour options, and material.</p>
    <p>The final project importantly should be able to choose from a large number of current properties on sale or still under construction and quickly load a virtual interior with exact dimensions of the chosen property. Once a skeleton of the property has been virtually constructed the user should have the ability to load a view of what the property currently looks like or what it is planned to look like, from there the user can customise the interior to their liking so that they can have an idea of what their ideal interior would look like. An important use for the app will be giving customers the ability plan exactly how they would design the interior of a property before they have purchased the property. To do this many measuring tools and viewing options will be available to the user as well as the ability to customise almost every aspect of the property interior. Finally once the use is happy with the property they have chosen and the planned layout of the interior they will be able to save their design and have it printed in a detail with multiple viewing angles including a new detailed floorplan and lists of exact colours, materials, and furniture used. This will help the user to feel confident with their decision and help them bring their virtual plan into the real world.</p>
    <p>By this time, our marketing and licensing teams intend to reach out to potential business partners, as well as sponsors which would greatly bolster our efforts. Business partners will likely include state-wide realtors and local real estate agents to provide a database of houses for which VR Home can create in-app 3D models, and large-scale furniture wholesalers who can provide a database of official furniture that can be licensed to us for use in VR Home. Lastly, we will need to get greenlit from the developers of the hardware we are using. While it is not necessary, VR Home has potential to gain much more publicity if it is recognized by the very headset that houses it.</p>
    <p>Upon securing partners and licenses, along with getting greenlit by the VR company, advertising and publicity campaigns can commence. Our plan would be to acquire as much exposure as we can. As VR Home is a very limited and niche project attempting to appeal to a nearly non-existing market, our results of this initial exposure could greatly impact the success of the final product. Should our efforts be, in fact, successful, VR Home can begin rolling out to registered realtor branches. Soon after, it can be released commercially via our website.</p>
    <p>By the end of our development stage, our evaluation can begin. While the project can still be expanded upon in the later years of its life cycle, our ambitions could very well change, and only we can decide whether we have completed our project. The success of VR Home will be reflected in this final report, as well as any personal recollections from the team: what went well, what could have been improved on, and what each of us have learned during the entirety of the project.</p>
    
    <h2>Scope Creep and Limitations</h2>
    
    <p>While VR Home is simple in its purposes and design, it is still susceptible to scope creep. Ambition is key to our project motivations, and the desire to add more features in the future will be very strong during the early design and development stages. If left unattended, these unnecessary features can bloat the already tight project plan and can damage the overall quality of the final product. To counteract this, limitations and constraints need to be set in order to maintain focus and lessen the chances of getting distracted from VR Home’s original purpose.</p>
    <p>Some constraints are already present due to the physical and digital limitations of the hardware and software being worked with, respectively. Some hardware limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The VR headset’s internal specifications</li>
        <li>The requirements of controllers or other peripherals</li>
        <li>The recommended space in order to properly operate VR technology</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>While some software limitations include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The engine’s graphical capabilities</li>
        <li>Data size</li>
        <li>Accessibility and learnability of some digital tools</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>On top of these limitations, some on-board constraints will have to be addressed in order to maintain focus on our intentions and try not to appeal to too wide of an audience. Within our four-week period, it should not be encouraged to suggest any additional primary features for VR Home during the initial design stage. As stated previously, minor features that could expand upon or improve our major features are welcome, but anything that reaches beyond our scope is not to be considered. The time required to develop larger additions would negatively affect development and, should it accumulate, greatly delay certain milestones. For the sixteen-week period and beyond, major features are more welcome, but only if it is proven to be beneficial to the outcome of the project. This would mean gathering feedback and suggestions from users.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the design philosophy is not to become subject to major overhaul at any point during the main development stage. Any inconsistencies in design would damage the integrity of our product and harm the overall quality of VR Home’s interface. User feedback during the design stage should help to hasten the finalization of the final design. However, surveys after the initial commercial rollout could justify a design overhaul in the future. But, the design during development should remain static as not to create any discrepancies and possibly disagreements within the team as well.</p>
    
	<br><h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
    
	<h2>Unity 3D</h2>
    <img src="unity%20img.png">
	<p>To develop the VR home inspection software we have chosen Unity as it is easy to use and free. The version of Unity being used will be the latest version of Unity that being Unity 2019.2. In addition, the VR home inspection software will need a VR headset which comes with its own dedicated VR controllers, for this reason The Oculus Quest will be most suited as it does not need external wires and does not rely on a PC. Through the use of the Oculus touch controllers users will be able to move freely within the confines of the chosen house to inspect all that is within, ranging from furniture to the unique colours of the walls inside rooms. A few group members have used Unity before to develop games, however, members lack experience when developing VR applications, this will impact the development process and cause problems with time constraints.

	<h2>Adobe XD</h2>
    <img src="xd%20image.png">
	<p>We are using Adobe XD for wireframing and mocking up our prototypes. It allows us to keep a consistent skeleton and navigation UI whilst all collaborating on different designs/views. XD also allows us to maintain a  consistent design pattern & UI elements throughout the app, which ultimately results in a more consistent look and feel. A few group members also have had previous experience with Adobe XD, which means we can rapidly scaffold the prototypes with ease.

	<h2>Metal (apart of the iOS SDK)</h2>
    <img src="metal%20img.png">
	<p>One of our primary platforms we will be developing to is iOS. Apple provides a simple API/ SDK that we can leverage to optimise our graphics and VR workloads with this near-direct access to the onboard GPU’s of the devices</p>

	<h2>AR Kit</h2>
    <img src="arkit%20img.png">
	<p></p>
	<a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/">ARKit Website</a>
    
    
	<br><h1>Testing</h1>
	<p>We will test our project with users in small sample groups of 5 participants which will all use the program in an ideal environment, in which they will be instructed to perform a range of tasks, and will be given a score on criteria such as effectiveness and efficiency. Areas which scores reflected poorly will be reevaluated and manipulated do better suit the users wants and needs.</p>
	<p>When we have succeeded in the program will meet the requirements that we intended in design and development stages. Furthermore, including the program responds correctly to all kinds of inputs such as the use and functionality of buttons, the program performs its functions in a reasonable timeframe, it is stable and doesn’t crash and most importantly achieves the key results the stakeholders desire.</p>
	<p>Surveys will be used as a means of sourcing test users and gather information about the users wants and needs but also their expectations of the working solution. A small group of approximately 10 individuals will be selected, the criteria in which will be used to select them will be the following: Individual wanting to buy/rent a home, Relatively tech savvy, between the ages of 25-30. Etc.</p>
	<br><h1>Timeframe</h1>
	<p>For our timeline we have broken it down into two sections.  The first 4 weeks which lead up to the presentation and then the next 10 weeks which is how we would plan our schedules if we were to go on and create this idea.  Furthermore we have developed a week by week framework which outlines the rough structure for how many hours we loosely plan on dedicating to rough tasks to complete our idea.  As VR Home is not required to be built by our presentation in week 5 we have dedicated our first 4 weeks into scoping and developing the technology and design required to improve the understanding shown in our presentation.  The next 10 weeks are dedicated to the build and design of the application as well as the organising of all business related side of the process such as marketing and meeting with companies to persuade and convince them to allow us to import there catalogues to assist with interior design.  Not only this but meeting with real estate companies to come to agreements and working out the finer details on how this application will benefit them and working around the rules and regulations of the real estate industry</p>
	<h2>Roadmap & development plan</h2>

	<br><h1>Risks</h1>
	<p>With a project as ambitious as this, there are many risks that need to be considered if it’s to see the light of success. Taking both the software and hardware into account means addressing potential damage from more than one front. Hardware development can have many physical limitations, while software can be very unpredictable and even more harmful if left too vulnerable.</p>
    
    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>One of the most obvious risks involving hardware would be when working with virtual reality technology. It’s safe to conclude that no one on the team have easy access to a virtual reality machine, let alone experienced it for an extensive amount of time. This will make it especially hard to understand the core knowledge behind this technology and can prove very troublesome during the first stages of development. </p>
    <p>Access alone will be one of the first initial problems: commercial headsets such as the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift can cost hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars when including accessories and other associated tools. This leads into the next hardware risk: compatibility. As virtual reality is still very experimental, companies that attempt to adopt this technology are very discreet with their research and development, causing their resulting products to be very mutually exclusive. </p>
    <p>While we are still trying to discover the best possible choice, an important decision will have to be made on what hardware the final piece will be used with. It would seem safer to pick a headset that is currently popular in this niche market—like the previously mentioned Vive—but we would face a couple of risks in doing so. Should more favourable virtual reality options become widely available, we might find our software difficult to be adopted by these competitors, hurting the possibility of widening our intended audience. The other risk would be if our chosen headset simply ceases development, rendering our product outdated within a few years, and completely unusable within a decade. However, there is another option.</p>
    <p>Quite possibly one the biggest risks for our hardware development would be the decision to develop our own virtual reality hardware to best accommodate the software. There are multiple benefits to this, though. Should we commit to our own tools, being able to create our own VR headset would give us the most freedom on the overall designs of both it and the associated software. We would also be able to maintain a niche but condensed target audience by supplying the software exclusively with our headset, preventing ourselves from streamlining its design and diluting its intended purposes. </p>
    <p>This, of course, brings great risks to our development. Financially, it would substantially increase development costs, and we would likely be forced to hire third-party services in order to not extend our plan beyond its scope. A lot more time would need to be allocated to ease pressure on development, possibly extending our initial plan by another year or more. Additionally, labour would be increased by a noticeable amount, as time is now dedicated to not only understanding the virtual reality hardware but creating the hardware itself. Lastly, as mentioned before, the birth of potential competitors would likely increase over time—maybe even competitors that can achieve our goal and possibly more—so development would potentially devolve into an arms race, further increasing labour and even introduce stress due to overall pressure.</p>
    
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The first possible risk involving our software would be the engine and/or platform we would develop it on. It would be ideal to develop our technology on engines such as Unity or Unreal, as they have very high graphical potential—which would be necessary given the level of detail required to display housing models in virtual reality—and are also known to be easier to access and work with. Using such popular engines, however, run the risks of our software being vulnerable to the engine’s own limitations and constraints, visually. There is always the possibility of creating our own engine to best satisfy this project’s needs but, like hardware, would require a lot more time, money, and effort to develop. </p>
    
	<br><h1>Group processes and communications</h1>
	<p>For our projects, we have been using Facebook and Steam for communication. Mostly discussions take place in class or in Facebook. It is important to keep updated with the Assignment progress, and some questions could also be asked on Facebook while all the group members online. We store our assignment data in Google Drive, and some in the Canvas group. We also have access to the GitHub repository, so we can modify things in the website easily. Each group member assigned a task on this assignment when discussion in class, so when we finished the class, we already know what to do and could arrange the time to do the assignment.</p>
	<p>From our last assignment, we are now trying to get better with the group communication and more focused on each member assigned. For every unclear issues, we can communicate it in group chat or by discussing in class. Most of us did a great job for the assignment, but just need to be more careful and read all the specifications correctly to improve our skills. </p>
	<h2>Communication Tools</h2>
    <p>We have decided that <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a> is the most suitable option for all-purpose communication. Every member has access to it and its messaging features make an easy choice for keeping all of us connected.</p>
	<h2>Document Management & Collaboration Tool</h2>
    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> is an effective general repository for any and all contributed material. It is also very accessible since we all have Google accounts associated with our student ID.</p>
	<h2>Version Control System</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is the best, and almost our only choice, for inserting our final source code for the site. We all have access to it and it is very easy to learn.</p>
