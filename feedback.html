    <h1>Group Feedback and Reflections</h1>
        
    <h2>Brian</h2>
        <p>I am honestly very satisfied with this group. Every single member has been a real treat to work with and we all seem to have this positive connection that keeps us all going. Times can be stressful, but these guys are always reassuring and considerate. Everyone pulls their own weight can we each have our own well-defined strengths. As for weaknesses, we seem to always have each other’s back when one of us is against the wall. Although we may have different overall future ambitions, I can always count on them to pull me out of a pinch.</p>
        
    <h2>Nicolas</h2>
        <p>I believe our group communicated well and every member completed their delegated tasks early to minimise the chance of rushed or incomplete work. Facebook messenger was used as our communication platform where I was able to update everyone on my progress with work and assist others if needed. As a group I believe we could have arranged to meet on a designated occasion just
to touch base in person and build a stronger cohesion between one another. I felt our ability to
share ideas and delegate tasks was surprisingly easy, considering we were all new to each other and
in most cases I may feel shy or uncomfortable to express ideas and/or give opinions on other group
members ideas. One thing I have learned about groups is to never feel afraid to express ideas as the
more ideas the more in depth a conversation can advance and then from there myself and other
members can cherry pick the most suitable and complimenting ideas towards the original project
proposal. GitHub was extremely helpful and was used to push a considerable amount of commits
which allowed myself to read and change any parts of my work if necessary.</p>
        
    <h2>Naufal</h2>
        <p>By far, every group member has done their job very well for this course. We always try to discuss everything for the assignment and allocate the time to do the tasks so it was done very carefully. From 4 members until now 7 members, we always focused on teamwork and getting it done before the due date. Our project is about the VRHome, that was the idea by Mason and we all agreed to use this idea and develop our project to be ready for prototype. Overall, this group is really good at teamwork and communication.</p>
        
    <h2>Harrison</h2>
        <p>I am super happy with how this group assignment has panned out.  The other guys in the group have been nothing short of absolute legends and we have worked efficiently and effectively together using our time in class to plan out our assignments, allocate roles and bounce ideas off each other to make our project and assignment the best it can be.  Not only this but communication between the Rush_B lads has been sublime with a healthy active facebook messenger chat which we all use to communicate about our assignment and ask/offer help and assistance to others if they need.  I know personally that because I am not an IT student but took the class as an elective to learn I would not have been able to survive this class or assignments without the other guys and they have my highest recommendations.  Never have I had a more effective team.</p>
        
    <h2>Atilla</h2>
        <p>Overall, I felt like it our group did well on this assignment. We certainly did get it done on time, we were able to communicate with each other with relative ease, and were able to effectively come up with a well-thought out and organised final submission. For the communication part, I felt like we didn’t really discuss this assignment as much as the previous one, but still made a fair effort to do so when we had the time. Our work wasn’t rushed or incomplete and we were able to share some good ideas with each other. I would take group work over individual work every day of the week, not only because you don’t have to do all of the work yourself, but because it’s a good opportunity to meet people you’ve never met before and build healthy relationships with them, which I believe we all successfully did.</p>

    <h2>Sam</h2>
        <p>Our assignment has progressed well in terms of the report writing. We have kept track of progress and tasks using Facebook messenger as our primary communication channel. We have also utilised Google Drive for collaborating on the documents live. Whilst some members work on documents independently and then add to the main report at certain milestones, all our documents are shared in the Google Drive folder for all members to work/edit. We are all active on Messenger, which has allowed us to still work at different paces and on different tasks whilst maintaining a level of collaboration and coordination across such a large team.</p>
        <p>This is a much larger team than usual, however working in this environment has still been effective due to our specific allocation of tasks and expectations of everyone to complete tasks on schedule. One area where we could improve is the collaboration on our prototype designs, of which we are using Adobe XD software. Not everyone has this software so only a few group members can assist with these prototype designs. However this has not been an issue. Overall, the tooling we utilised to complete the project have been effective and enabled a collaborative enough environment to achieve the required tasks.</p>
